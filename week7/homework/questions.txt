Code:
  Add devise for login/logout with tests
  Add one ActionMailer with tests

Questions:
  1. What is devise and why should we use it instead of creating our own login pattern?
	Devise is a ruby gem that has ready to use authentication for rails apps. It has a lot of built-in functionalities that you can easily enable or disable. It saves time from developing a secure authentication system. 

  2. How would devise require login before the home action on a welcome controller?
	in the before action before_action :authenticate_user! you can use it to require login before home action.

  3. If I wanted to send an email each time a resource in my application was created how would I do it? (Pretend I have a FunMailer ActionMailer class with a notify_about_resource method)
Youâ€™d do it this way: 
	email = FunMailer.notify_about_resource(resource)
	email.deliver
	
  4. What is Authorization? How is it different from Authentication?
	Authorization is the set of rules that determine who is allowed to access to the system or part of the system. Authentication is the set of keys/information that you need to get authenticated to the system. So a user can authenticate to the system but might not authorized to view some of the content.
